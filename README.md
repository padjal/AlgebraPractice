# Math Practice

This repo contains laboratory works from my applied math python university course.

We use math concepts and translate them programmatically using the libraries sympy and numpy.

# Organization

All tasks are completed inside a jupyter notebook (.ipynb). Two main folders contain the files for the two main Math subjects respectively.
